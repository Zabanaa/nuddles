# Nuddles

Nuddles is a Node.js wrapper for the foursquare API.
It will enable you to effortlessly query their multiple endpoints.
We make no assumptions about how you are going to use it, we just return the data to
you. You are free do manipulate the results as you wish.

_Please note that Nuddles currently only supports userless access but plans to add OAuth
authentication are in the pipeline_
